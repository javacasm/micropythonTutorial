Bare modules for m5Stack micropython 1.12
from https://github.com/lukasmaximus89/M5Stack-Core-Micropython-1.12
If you wish to use pure micropython with your M5Stack device rather than UiFlow you can download
these modules and transfer them to your M5Stack with a program such as uPyloader, VScode, Mu or Thonny
